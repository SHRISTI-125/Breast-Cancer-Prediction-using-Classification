# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression
Cancer refers to any one of a large number of diseases characterized by the development of abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably and have the ability to infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue. 
Cancer often has the ability to spread throughout your body. Breast cancer is a disease in which abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumours. If left unchecked, the tumours can spread throughout the body.

This project uses Logistic Regression to predict the presence of breast cancer based on a dataset of features extracted from breast cancer diagnostic tests. The goal is to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

# 📌 Overview
1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. The survival rate for breast cancer depends on the stage of the cancer, and has improved significantly in recent years due to advances in treatment and early detection. 
This project utilizes a Logistic Regression approach to classify tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). It provides an interpretable model to understand which features are most impactful in prediction.
Benign is Non-Cancerous, but survival rate of Malignant is 95%.<br>
<h3>Mammography</h3>
<p>Mammography is one of the efficient way to detect breast cancer at early stage.
  A mammogram is a low-dose X-ray of your breast tissue. Healthcare providers use mammograms, or mammography, to look for early signs of breast cancer before symptoms develop.</p>

# 📑 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data), which includes:
569 samples of breast cancer cases.
30 numeric features (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, area).
Target Variable:
M (Malignant) = 1
B (Benign) = 0
